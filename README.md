# Exercise Instructor using AI

This repository contains code and resources for an AI-powered exercise instructor that analyzes exercise videos, extracts key points, calculates angles, and evaluates performance in real-time.

## Project Structure

- `KeyPointExtraction_AngleCalculation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for extracting key points from exercise videos and calculating angles.
- `ROI_frames.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for identifying and processing regions of interest (ROI) in video frames.
- `ROI_from_video.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for extracting ROI from videos.
- `RT-LessScore.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for real-time scoring based on extracted key points and angles.
- `videoLateral.mp4`: Sample exercise video used for testing and demonstration.
